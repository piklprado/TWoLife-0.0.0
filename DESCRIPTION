Description: Provides a comprehensive framework for individual-based ecological 
    simulations featuring spatial population dynamics, genetic variation, 
    phenotypic plasticity, and habitat selection in heterogeneous landscapes. 
    Implements fast 'C++' algorithms via 'Rcpp' for birth-death-dispersal 
    processes with density dependence and evolutionary mechanisms. Enables 
    researchers to study eco-evolutionary dynamics, range expansion, adaptive 
    landscapes, and the interplay between genetic evolution and spatial 
    heterogeneity. Suitable for applications in conservation biology, 
    evolutionary ecology, and landscape genetics.
